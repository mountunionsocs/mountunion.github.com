**TL;DR**: We have a speaker coming on March 4th, there's an awesome video about programming you should watch, introduced a new award "SOCS of the week" for members who are awesome. Also, Aaron has shared his Canvas documents for anyone interested in expanding on their competition ideas. 

### Guest speaker coming

1983 Mount Union grad Phil Henninge is coming on Monday, March 4th at 1:45 PM. He will be speaking in the EBB 2nd-floor lounge. 

### Code.org video

You should definitely check out [this awesome video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKIu9yen5nc) from the folks at [Code.org](http://code.org). It features the likes of Gates, Zuckerburg, Bosh and Will.I.Am talking about the importance of programming in schools. You should watch it just for Will.I.Am though. 

### SOCS of the Week

A new award will be given out each week to a member who is awesome. "Awesome" is a loose term, and can apply to any number of things. Grounds for winning SOCS of the Week include: doing great on a test / exam, telling the best joke of the night, writing some awesome commits to [our GitHub projects](http://github.com/mu-socs/), and so on. The prize is actually a pair of socks. So, you know, try to be awesome. 

### Canvas documents for T2 competition 

Aaron kindly supplied [blank and example Canvas documents](http://cl.ly/NHB1) for those looking to get started building out their technology business idea. If you have any questions about the upcoming competition, feel free to shoot Aaron an email.
