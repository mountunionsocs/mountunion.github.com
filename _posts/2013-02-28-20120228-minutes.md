**TL;DR**: We have a speaker coming on March 4th, there's an awesome video about programming you should watch, introduced a new award "SOCS of the week" for members who are awesome. 

### Guest speaker coming

1983 Mount Union grad Phil Henninge is coming on Monday, March 4th at 1:45 PM. He will be speaking in the EBB 2nd-floor lounge. 

### Code.org video

You should definitely check out [this awesome video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKIu9yen5nc) from the folks at [Code.org](http://code.org). It features the likes of Gates, Zuckerburg, Bosh and Will.I.Am talking about the importance of programming in schools. You should watch it just for Will.I.Am though. 

### SOCS of the Week

A new award will be given out each week to a member who is awesome. "Awesome" is a loose term, and can apply to any number of things. Grounds for winning SOCS of the Week include: doing great on a test / exam, telling the best joke of the night, writing some awesome commits to [our GitHub projects](http://github.com/mu-socs/), and so on. The prize is actually a pair of socks. So, you know, try to be awesome. 

### Questions about T2 or the competition? 

Please contact Aaron DeAngelis if you have any questions about the upcoming competition. He has some awesome techniques to get your idea into something presentable and I highly encourage you to set up some time to talk.
