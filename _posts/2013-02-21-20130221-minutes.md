**TL;DR**: Entrepreneurship competition, GitHub (please complete the [Gitting started](/posts/gitting-started)) guide, upcoming officer elections

### Guest speaker

Matthew Stinson talked with us about an upcoming entrepreneurship competition. Basically, come up with an idea (tech related) and then pitch it at the competition for a chance to win some money. Typically, the winner of the competition would win $500, but recently an alumni donated an extra $500 for the best technology idea. Therefore, if you were the best technology idea *and* the best idea overall, you pocket $1000. 

Aaron DeAngelis is very familiar with the process and competition, so if you have any questions please shoot him an email at <deangeaj@mountunion.edu>. 

### GitHub

We are now a GitHub organization. This means some awesome stuff in terms of collaborating on SOCS open source projects (MUPanel v2!). Before next meeting, please go check out and follow our [Gitting started](http://mu-socs.github.com/posts/gitting-started) guide. 

### Officers

If you are interested in becoming an officer, please let me know and we can help you prepare for elections this April.
