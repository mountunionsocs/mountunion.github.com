<h4><em><a href="index.html">Home</a> / Gitting started</em></h4>

<p>Welcome to the SOCS Gitting Started Guide. We're going to help you set up a GitHub account and join our <a href="http://github.com/mu-socs">SOCS GitHub organization</a>. That way you can download any of our source code or organization documents, make changes, and push them back to the master branch. Teamwork for the win!</p>

<h2>Wait, what's GitHub?</h2>

<p>GitHub is a social code sharing site. You make an account, upload some of your open source projects, and then others can contribute, fix bugs and do all sorts of fun things.</p>

<p>What's even better is that Netbeans recently started supporting <em>git</em> (more on that in a bit), which means that all our code on GitHub can easily be downloaded, edited and pushed back all from our lab PCs. </p>

<p>Coming soon..</p>
