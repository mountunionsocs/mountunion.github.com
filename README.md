## Contributing

Want to write a post for our website? It can be about anything technology related you want. Here's how to get started: 

- Create a new document in the _posts/ folder of the site. [Click here](https://github.com/mu-socs/mu-socs.github.com/new/master/_posts) to create a new document in the browser. 
- Write in [Markdown format](http://markdownlivepreview.com/). If you need an example, check out the [format of our minutes](https://raw.github.com/mu-socs/mu-socs.github.com/master/_posts/2013-02-21-20130221-minutes.md). 

There are some things to remember: 
1. When you name your file, use the ".md" extension. 
2. The top of your file must contain the following: 

```
---
layout: post
title: your title
---
```

After that, feel free to write whatever Markdown you want. 

Happy posting!
